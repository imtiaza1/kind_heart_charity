# ❤️ Kind Heart Charity – Website Clone

## 📝 About the Project  
**Kind Heart Charity** is a simple frontend website I recreated for practice using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It’s based on a real charity site and includes info about the charity, a donation form, and a clean, mobile-friendly design.

## 📦 How to Use  
1. Clone the repository  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project folder  
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser



 – feel free to use or modify it.
